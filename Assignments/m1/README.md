In this programming assignment we will create a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset.
Functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. 
In addition, we will need to reorder this data set from large to small. All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. 
After analysis and sorting is done, we will need to print that data.
