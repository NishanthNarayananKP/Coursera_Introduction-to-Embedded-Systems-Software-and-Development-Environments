### <ins>Assignment Requirements</ins>:  

In this programming assignment we will create a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make. 
This assignment will require to compile multiple files, link them together and create a final output executable. 
We will need to support two platforms; the host environment and the target embedded system MSP432. 
The host system will allow you to simulate software on a host platform. 
The target system will be used in upcoming assignments as we begin to create our microcontroller applications.
