### DESCRIPTION: This file demonstrates the learning topics in this course

### COURSE: "Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments"

#### Module 1: Embedded System Development Components
1.1 Embedded Systems Overview\
1.2 Environment\
1.3 Hardware\
1.4 Software\
1.5 C-Programming Review\
1.6 Software Configuration Management (SCM)\
1.7 Version Control

- The first week introduces the embedded systems, software configuration management, C standardization, coding standards, documentation and version control with git. The week assignment is to write a simple C program to do some operations on arrays, apply the learned topics on that code such as writing high quality, documented code as well as working with git.
				
#### Module 2: Compilation with GCC and GNU Make
2.1 Building Software\
2.2 GCC Toolchain\
2.3 GNU Make\
2.4 Analyzing Compiled Code

- Second week illustrates the full build process as well as working with makefiles. The week assignment is to write a makefile automating the whole building process for 2 different architectures, generating dependancy files as well as memory map file for the application.
				
#### Module 3: Memory Types, Segments and Management
3.1 Memory Systems\
3.2 Software to Hardware Memory Interface\
3.3 Writing Code for Different Program Segments

- Third week illustrates the memory types, segments, and subsegments used in embedded systems. The week assignment is to analyze a project with some GCC tools like `objdump` and `nm` as well as the memory map file and determine each variable is stored in which segment and subsegment in memory.

#### Module 4: Course 1 Final Assessment

- During the fourth week you are to going to combine what you have learned in modules 1-3 to write some memory manipulation software, incorporate into your build system and then run some test functions.
